# Assign-Grade
With the help of Thonny, a function was created that assigns a letter grade based on the students' numerical grades/scores. This function will take an integer score as an input and will utilize if-elif-else statement to classify it into a letter grade. The score that they will be inputting must be greater than zero and less than 100.
